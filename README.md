Project Overview: 

Student Grade Management System

This project involves developing a Java application that allows users to track and manage student grades. The system will enable users to input grades for various subjects or assignments, calculate the average grade, and display the overall grade, including additional information such as letter grade and GPA. The application will be console-based for simplicity, but can be extended to a GUI in the future.

Key Features

1. Input Grades:
   - Users can enter grades for different subjects or assignments.
   - Grades can be entered as numerical values.

2. Calculate Average Grade:
   - The application will calculate the average grade based on the entered grades.

3. Display Grades:
   - Display individual grades for each subject/assignment.
   - Display the average grade.
   - Convert and display the average grade as a letter grade.
   - Convert and display the average grade as GPA.

4. Grade Conversion:
   - Define a mapping between numerical grades and letter grades.
   - Define a mapping between numerical grades and GPA.

5. Persistence (Optional):
   - Save grades to a file.
   - Load grades from a file.
